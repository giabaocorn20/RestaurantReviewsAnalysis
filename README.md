# Restaurant Reviews Analysis Jupyter Notebook
This is a Jupyter Notebook that uses the SerpApi and Cohere APIs to analyze restaurant reviews. It retrieves reviews for a specific restaurant using the SerpApi, then uses Cohere's natural language processing (NLP) to determine the sentiment of each review and extract adjectives and nouns.

## Prerequisites
To use this notebook, you'll need to have the following Python packages installed:

- serpapi - for retrieving reviews from the SerpApi
- cohere - for performing NLP analysis on the reviews
- matplotlib - for visualizing the data
- pandas - for working with dataframes
- numpy - for performing numerical operations
- sklearn - for machine learning tasks
- nltk - for text processing tasks

You'll also need to obtain API keys for the SerpApi and Cohere APIs.

## Steps

1. Import the necessary Python packages.
2. Set up the SerpApi client and define the search parameters (e.g. the name and location of the restaurant you want to analyze).
3. Retrieve the restaurant reviews using the SerpApi client.
4. Preprocess the reviews (e.g. remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, tokenize) using the nltk package.
5. Use Cohere's sentiment analysis API to determine the sentiment of each review.
6. Extract adjectives and nouns from the reviews using the nltk package.
7. Visualize the frequency of adjectives and nouns in the reviews using a bar chart.
8. Split the reviews into training and testing sets.
9. Train a logistic regression model on the training set.
10. Use the model to predict the sentiment of the reviews in the testing set.
11. Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, and recall.
12. Use the model to classify new reviews as positive or negative based on their adjectives and nouns.
13. Use Cohere's text summarization API to extract the key topics discussed in the positive and negative reviews.
14. Use Cohere's text generation API to generate advice based on the key topics discussed in the positive and negative reviews.
15. Use the SHAP library to visualize the impact of each feature (i.e. each adjective and noun) on the model's predictions.

## Usage
To use this notebook, simply open it in Jupyter and run the cells. The notebook will retrieve reviews for a specific restaurant, perform sentiment analysis and extract adjectives and nouns from the reviews, and then visualize the results using a bar chart.

## Output
The output of this notebook is a bar chart that shows the frequency of adjectives and nouns in the restaurant reviews. This can help you get an idea of what customers are saying about the restaurant, and what aspects of the restaurant are most frequently mentioned. The notebook also generates a logistic regression model that can be used to predict the sentiment of new reviews and extract key topics and advice from the reviews.
